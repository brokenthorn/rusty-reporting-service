# Rusty Reporting Service ‚è∞

This is a small, special purpose reporting service I built for my employer during my free time
spent learning Rust (which is the reason I called it "rusty").

The service's main purpose is to schedule certain database queries to run
at specific intervals and then build reports in various formats and share
them via email or FTP.
