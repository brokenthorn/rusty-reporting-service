# Rusty Reporting Service
A reporting service I initially built for Mini-Farm.
I wrote it while learning Rust, so I called it "rusty". ðŸ˜‰

A lot of gratitude goes out to [@steffengy](https://github.com/steffengy) (Steffen Butzer)
the creator of the [tiberius](https://github.com/steffengy/tiberius) async MSSQL driver for Rust.
